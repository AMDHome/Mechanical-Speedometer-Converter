# Mechanical-Speedometer-Converter
Mechanical Speedometer Converter for ECS 193 (Senior Design)

## App
There is an APK in [Releases](https://github.com/AMDHome/Mechanical-Speedometer-Converter/releases) that can be installed
The source code for it will be under the app folder in the repo. Android Studio is required to compile it.
The app requires android 8.0 as google play store requires that.

## Controller Program
The source code for the controller is in the controller file (named controller.ino). You will need to open it in the Arduino IDE. Make sure wiring2.cpp and wiring2.h are in the same folder as controller.ino when you open it. From there plug in your Arduino, unplug the bluetooth module and click upload. Once upload is done, you can put the arduino module back on.

## Hardware Manual
The Hardware manual is in the controller folder. It is the Readme.md file
